# Sample ALiEM Case Structure

This document shows the recommended structure for ALiEM EM ReSCu Peds cases.

## Case: Status Epilepticus

### Case ID: aliem-case-01

### Stage 1: Initial Assessment
**Objectives:**
- Recognize status epilepticus
- Assess airway, breathing, circulation
- Identify red flags

**Critical Actions:**
- [ ] Secure airway if compromised
- [ ] Assess breathing and oxygenation
- [ ] Check circulation and vital signs
- [ ] Identify seizure duration and type
- [ ] Look for trauma or other causes

**Actor Prompts:**
- "What do you see when you walk into the room?"
- "What are your first priorities?"
- "How do you assess the airway?"

**Pitfalls:**
- Delaying airway management
- Not checking for trauma
- Missing underlying causes

### Stage 2: Immediate Intervention
**Objectives:**
- Administer first-line anti-epileptic medication
- Monitor response
- Prepare for escalation

**Critical Actions:**
- [ ] Administer benzodiazepine (lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV)
- [ ] Monitor seizure activity
- [ ] Prepare second-line medication
- [ ] Establish IV access if not present

**Actor Prompts:**
- "What medication do you give first?"
- "How do you calculate the dose?"
- "What do you do if the seizure continues?"

**Pitfalls:**
- Incorrect dosing
- Not monitoring response
- Delaying second-line treatment

### Stage 3: Escalation
**Objectives:**
- Administer second-line medication if needed
- Consider intubation
- Address underlying causes

**Critical Actions:**
- [ ] Administer second-line anti-epileptic (fosphenytoin or levetiracetam)
- [ ] Consider intubation for airway protection
- [ ] Order diagnostic studies
- [ ] Consult neurology

**Actor Prompts:**
- "The seizure is still ongoing, what's your next step?"
- "When do you consider intubation?"
- "What diagnostic studies do you order?"

**Pitfalls:**
- Not escalating appropriately
- Missing underlying causes
- Inadequate monitoring

### Debrief Points
**What Went Well:**
- Rapid recognition of status epilepticus
- Appropriate first-line medication
- Systematic approach to assessment

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Airway assessment timing
- Dose calculation accuracy
- Escalation planning

**Key Learning Points:**
- Status epilepticus is a medical emergency
- Airway management is priority
- Have escalation plan ready
- Monitor response to treatment
